    "   - **Subscriber**: listens for and \"subscribes\" to messages from a topic or channel.\n",
    "   - **Topic (or Channel)**: A logical channel or message queue that holds the messages. \n",

    "   - **Publishing**: A publisher sends a message to a topic. It does not need to know or care who the subscribers are. \n",
